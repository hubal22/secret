/*
Solution to:
A Secret encapsulates a function that accepts a single integer parameter and returns an integer. 
Secret is a given but you don’t know its implementation. 
In Java or a language of your choice, write an application that determines 
if Secret is an additive function secret(x+y) = secret(x) + secret(y) for all 
combinations of prime numbers less than N where N is also a given.
*/

to run the program:

java -jar secret.jar

and follow prompts



or compile Secret.java and run


the secret function in this source code is additive. You can modify the function by uncommenting the line for 
non additive test case.

I used java for this solution because this is the primary language I use.
